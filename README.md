# ARTIFICIAL NEURAL NETWORK
# Customer Churn Prediction

This repository contains a machine learning model designed to predict customer churn based on demographic and account information. The model can be used by businesses to identify customers at risk of leaving and take proactive measures to retain them.

## Data Description
The `Churn_Modelling.csv` dataset includes customer attributes such as credit score, geography, gender, and account balance, as well as the target variable `Exited` (1 for churned, 0 for not churned).

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib (for visualization)

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/shrimali-1/artificial_neural_network.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the model: `jupyter notebook artificial_neural_network.ipynb
`
